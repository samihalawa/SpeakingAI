Interactive chat interface for Spanish language practice
Automatic vocabulary capture and management system storing:
Spanish words/phrases
Chinese translations
Timestamps
Two usage examples per entry
Vocabulary filtering and organization tools
Real-time vocabulary list updates during chat sessions

I'll help you create a Spanish language learning platform with an AI-powered chat interface and comprehensive vocabulary management. We'll use React and Express with real-time features, following your Spanish-influenced design theme. The system will store vocabulary with Chinese translations and usage examples in PostgreSQL. Would you like to proceed with the implementation?

A PWS Spanish language learning chatbot that serves as both tutor and translator, focusing on advanced (B2 level) Spanish learners.

Core Features *depending on systme prompting basically

Bi-directional translation between Spanish-Chinese and Spanish-English with language preference setting
AI will explain complex vocabulary and expressions (B2 level and above)
Contextual explanations of idioms and cultural nuances
other features

Continuous chat functionality with suggestion chips for common learning paths
Vocabulary management system for saved words/phrases
UI/Style:

Floating action buttons for quick vocabulary saves that don't interrupt chat flow
Compact suggestion chips that don't dominate the chat interface
-must allow taking the text using OCR form multiple images and correctly prompt the AI so it outputs it and translates it and explains a bit.
